==============

This repository will contain random algorithm problems I resolve to solve at least one a day. Each problem will have detailed explanation of the problem, sample input, output and algorithm technique. 

| Day | Problem Description                   | Ex. Input                                         | Ex. Output                                                                             | Technique                     |
