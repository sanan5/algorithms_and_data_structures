# algorithms_and_ds_playground
This repository will contain random algorithm and data structure problems I resolve to solve at least one a day.

## Current Streak
**15 days**
## Longest streak
15 days (August 17, 2015 - August 31, 2015)

## Include Directiory
Include directory and sub directories contain STL like header file implementation of various algorithms and data structures. Following header only implementation,
these files contain all the function implementation. Source files in problem directories explain the problems we are trying to solve and call these routines.

I am continously learning, and always happy to receive feedback. If you see an issue, or incorrect implementation of concepts,
please let me know.
