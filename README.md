### Stack Problems
| Problem | Solution |
| :------------ | :----------: |
|  We have series of n daily price quotes for a stock. We need to calculate span of stock's price for all n days. Span for ith day is defined as maximum number of consecutive days, for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to ith day. For stock quotes {100, 60, 70, 65, 80, 85} span will be {1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5}. Span for day 1 is always 1, now for day 2 stock is at 60, and there is no day befor it when stock was less than 60. So span remains 1. For day 3, the stock is priced at 70, so its span is 2, as previous day it was 60, and so on. | [stock_span_problem.cpp](stack_problems/stock_span_problem.cpp) |
