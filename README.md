# algorithms_and_ds_playground
This repository will contain random algorithm and data structure problems I resolve to solve at least one a day.

## Current Streak
**27 days**
## Longest streak
27  days (August 17, 2015 - Sept 12, 2015)

## Include Directiory
Include directory and sub directories contain STL like header file implementation of various algorithms and data structures. Following header only implementation,
these files contain all the function implementation. Source files in problem directories explain the problems we are trying to solve and call these routines.

I am continously learning, and always happy to receive feedback. If you see an issue, or incorrect implementation of concepts,
please let me know.

## So Far

#### Cracking the coding interview
    - Problem 1 : Determine if a string has unique chars.
    - Problem 2 : (Edition 5) Reverse a c-string.
    - Problem 2 : (Edition 6) Determine if two string are permutations of each other.
    - Problem 3 : (Edition 5) Remove duplicate chars from a string
    - Problem 3 : (Edition 6) Urlify string
    - Problem 4 : (Edition 6) Pallindrome Permutation
    - Problem 5 : (Edition 6) One edit away
#### Sorting
    - Quick Sort
    - Bubble Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Merge Sort
#### Linked List
    - STL like implementation (include dir)
    - Find the nth node of linked list from last.
    - Add numbers where each digit of the number is represented by node of a linkedlist.
      Give output as a linked list.
    - Swap nodes of a linkedlist without swapping data
    - Given a linked list, reverse alternate nodes and append at the end
    - Only given a node pointer, delete the node from the linked list.
    - Delete the entire linkedlist
    - Print middle node of linkedlist without iterating twice.
#### Tree
    - STL like implementation (include dir)
    - Pretty Print of a tree
    - Mirror tree
    - Find predecessor and successor of a key in binary search tree.
    - Level Order Traversal ( Iterative + Recursive )
    - Zig-Zag/Spiral Traversal
#### Strings
    - Robin Karp algorithm.
#### Stack
    - STL like implementation (include dir)
    - Stock span problem 
### Queue
    - STL like implementation (include dir)
### Bit Manipulation
    - Determine if a number is a power of 2.
    - Add two binary number represented as string.
    - Determine the next power of 2 for a given number.
    - Using bit manipulation determine if a number is multiple of 3.
    - Determine endianess of the machine, print a number in reverse Endianess.
    - Find the parity of given number.
    - Implement fast multiplication of a number to 7 using bit manipulation.
    - Reverse bits of unsigned integer (two methods - Reversing bit by bit & divide and conquer)
